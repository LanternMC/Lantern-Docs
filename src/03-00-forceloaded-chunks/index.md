# Forceloaded Chunks

For each of the three dimensions in Minecraft, Lantern forceloads the chunk at
`-30000000 0 8880`. Each chunk has a lectern at `-30000000 0 8880`, a sign at
`-30000000 0 8881`, and a yellow shulker box at `-30000000 0 8882`.

Additionally, a single armor stand with the UUID `cb-0-0-0-1` is placed in the
Overworld's forceloaded chunk at `-30000000 0 8880`.

Placing blocks in this chunk at or above Y 2 is allowed, however keep in mind
that other data packs may do the same, so do not store anything permanent in
this space. Y 0 and Y 1 are reserved for Lantern use only.

The next four pages will explain the forceloaded utilities in more detail.
